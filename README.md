# DotFiles

Various configurations I'll share between computers.

Most should be both Linux and OS X compatible.

## Install

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:tlhunter/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./install.sh
```

## Updating

```bash
~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

### ~/.vimrc

Vim configration files are located at [github.com/tlhunter/vimrc](https://github.com/tlhunter/vimrc).
